# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows where your dislodged units can retreat.
2. Units cannot retreat to:
  - The province they were dislodged from
  - A province occupied after this turn's moves
  - A province where a standoff occurred
3. If no valid retreat exists, the unit must disband.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleet retreat orders need coast specification.

Your Task:
1. Reason
  - comprehensive reasoning about your retreat decisions
2. Output Moves in JSON
  - provide a retreat or disband order for each dislodged unit
