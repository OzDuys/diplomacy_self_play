IMPORTANT: You are a formatting assistant. Your ONLY job is to extract Diplomacy game orders from the response below and format them properly.

The response will contain strategic analysis and order suggestions. Look for the actual orders (movements, holds, supports, etc.).

Required format:
PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": ["order1", "order2", "order3"]
}}

Order format examples:
- Hold: "A PAR H"
- Move: "A PAR - MAR", "F BRE - MAO"
- Support: "A MAR S A PAR - BUR", "F MAO S F BRE - ENG"
- Convoy: "F MAO C A BRE - LON"
- Build: "A PAR B", "F BRE B"
- Disband: "A PAR D"
- Retreat: "A PAR - BUR"
- Dual-coast: "F STP/SC" (south coast), "F SPA/NC" (north coast)

Example 1 - France Spring 1901:
If the response mentions:
"I'll move army from Paris to Burgundy, fleet from Brest to Mid-Atlantic, and hold Marseilles"

Extract as:
PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A PAR - BUR",
    "F BRE - MAO",
    "A MAR H"
  ]
}}

Example 2 - Italy with supports:
If the response mentions:
"Venice attacks Trieste with support from Apulia and Ionian Sea"

Extract as:
PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A VEN - TRI",
    "A APU S A VEN - TRI",
    "F ION S A VEN - TRI"
  ]
}}

Example 3 - Build phase:
If the response mentions:
"Build army in Paris and fleet in Marseilles"

Extract as:
PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A PAR B",
    "F MAR B"
  ]
}}

Example 4 - Germany Spring 1901:
If the response mentions:
"Denmark (DEN) and Holland (HOL) are key neutral centers for early German expansion. Need to secure Berlin (BER) and Munich (MUN) against potential French or Russian incursions. Kiel (KIE) fleet is best positioned for DEN, while an army from Ruhr (RUH) can take HOL."

Extract as:
PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A BER H",
    "A MUN H",
    "F KIE - DEN",
    "A RUH - HOL",
    "A SIL - WAR",
    "F HEL H"
  ]
}}

Example 5 - Italy Autumn 1902:
If the response mentions:
"My primary goal is to take Trieste (TRI) from Austria. Army in Venice (VEN) will attack, supported by Army in Apulia (APU). Fleet in Ionian Sea (ION) will support the attack on Trieste from the sea. Army in Rome (ROM) will hold to protect the capital. Fleet in Naples (NAP) will move to Tyrrhenian Sea (TYS) to defend against a potential French move."

Extract as:
PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  "orders": [
    "A VEN - TRI",
    "A APU S A VEN - TRI",
    "F ION S A VEN - TRI",
    "A ROM H",
    "F NAP - TYS"
  ]
}}

Instructions:
- Look for lines that describe unit movements (e.g., "A BER - KIE", "Move Berlin to Kiel")
- Convert natural language to standard format:
  - "Move army from Berlin to Kiel" → "A BER - KIE"
  - "Fleet in Kiel moves to Denmark" → "F KIE - DEN"
  - "Hold in Munich" → "A MUN H"
- Use exact 3-letter province codes (BER, KIE, MUN, etc.)
- Include ALL units that were given orders
- If you see "Order:" followed by a properly formatted order, use it directly
- Common patterns to look for:
  - "A/F [PROVINCE] - [PROVINCE]" (movement)
  - "A/F [PROVINCE] H" (hold)
  - "A/F [PROVINCE] S A/F [PROVINCE] - [PROVINCE]" (support)
