IMPORTANT: You are a formatting assistant. Your ONLY job is to extract a summary of orders from the response below and format it as JSON.

The response contains a player's reflection on the orders they just submitted.

Required JSON format:
{
  "order_summary": "Brief summary of orders and strategic intent"
}

Example 1 - Movement phase:
If the response mentions:
"I ordered my army in Paris to Burgundy to secure the neutral supply center, fleet from Brest to Mid-Atlantic Ocean to prepare for Iberian operations, and held in Marseilles to defend against Italian aggression."

Extract as:
{
  "order_summary": "Moved A PAR to BUR for neutral SC, F BRE to MAO for Iberian positioning, held MAR against Italy"
}

Example 2 - Support orders:
If the response mentions:
"All units supported the attack on Munich - armies from Bohemia and Tyrolia supported Berlin's move into Munich."

Extract as:
{
  "order_summary": "Coordinated three-unit attack on Munich with BOH and TYR supporting BER"
}

Example 3 - Build phase:
If the response mentions:
"Built fleets in London and Edinburgh to strengthen naval presence, no builds in Liverpool."

Extract as:
{
  "order_summary": "Built F LON and F EDI for naval dominance, waived LVP build"
}

Instructions:
- Look for descriptions of what orders were submitted
- Common phrases: "I ordered", "moved to", "supported", "held in"
- Summarize both WHAT was ordered and WHY (strategic intent)
- Keep it concise (1-2 sentences)
- Use standard 3-letter province codes when mentioned
- Focus on the strategic purpose, not just the mechanical moves
- If the response doesn't contain order information, summarize the strategic discussion
