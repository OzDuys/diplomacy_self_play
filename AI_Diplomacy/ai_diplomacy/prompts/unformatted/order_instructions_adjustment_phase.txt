PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL ADJUSTMENT PHASE RULES
1. Only use orders from the provided possible_orders list
2. You can only build in unoccupied HOME supply centers you currently control
3. Build orders format: '[UnitType] [Location] B'
   - UnitType: 'A' (Army) or 'F' (Fleet)
   - Example: 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
4. Disband orders format: '[UnitType] [Location] D'
   - Example: 'A PAR D', 'F LON D'
5. Dual-coast provinces require coast specification for fleet builds:
   - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST] B' where [COAST] = NC, SC, EC, or WC
   - Example: 'F STP/NC B', 'F SPA/SC B'

ADJUSTMENT DECISION PROCESS
1. CALCULATE
   - Count your supply centers
   - Count your current units
   - Determine builds or disbands needed

2. STRATEGIZE
   - Where to build for maximum strategic impact
   - Which units to disband if necessary
   - Balance between armies and fleets

3. PRIORITIZE
   - Build in threatened home centers first
   - Build units that support your strategic goals
   - Disband isolated or least useful units

Please respond in two parts:

1. REASONING: First, explain your adjustment analysis. How many supply centers do you control? How many units do you have? Where will you build and why? If disbanding, which units are least valuable?

2. ADJUSTMENT ORDERS: Then, list all your build (B) or disband (D) orders. Be precise with unit types (A/F) and locations.
