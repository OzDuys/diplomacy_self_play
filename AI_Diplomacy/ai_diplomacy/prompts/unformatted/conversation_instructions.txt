DIPLOMATIC MESSAGING TASK

You need to compose diplomatic messages to other powers in this negotiation phase.

IMPORTANT: This is about WRITING MESSAGES to other powers, not analyzing strategy or choosing orders.

GUIDELINES
- Respond to messages in "RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION" section
- Propose deals, alliances, or coordination
- Share (or mislead about) your intentions
- Build trust or sow discord as needed
- You can send multiple messages
- You can choose to ignore certain powers

RESPOND IN TWO PARTS:

1. REASONING: Explain your diplomatic approach:
   - Which powers are you prioritizing for communication?
   - What messages need responses?
   - What deals or coordination are you proposing?
   - Are you being honest or deceptive?
   - Who are you deliberately not messaging and why?

2. MESSAGES: List the actual messages to send:
   - For EACH message specify:
     * Type: "global" (all see it) or "private" (only recipient sees)
     * Recipient: If private, which power (AUSTRIA, ENGLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, RUSSIA, TURKEY)
     * Content: The actual message text
   - Be specific and diplomatic in your wording
   - Examples:
     * Private to FRANCE: "I'm planning to move to the Channel. Will you support me?"
     * Global: "I propose we all respect current borders this turn."
     * Private to RUSSIA: "If you stay out of Galicia, I'll support you into Rumania."

REMEMBER: You are writing diplomatic messages, not explaining your overall strategy or orders.
