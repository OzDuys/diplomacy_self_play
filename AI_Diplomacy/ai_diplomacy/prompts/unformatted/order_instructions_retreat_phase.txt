PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

CRITICAL RETREAT PHASE RULES
1. The possible orders section shows where your dislodged units can retreat
2. Units cannot retreat to:
   - The province they were dislodged from
   - A province occupied after this turn's moves
   - A province where a standoff occurred
3. If no valid retreat exists, the unit must disband
4. Retreat format: '[UnitType] [From] - [To]'
   - Example: 'A PAR - BUR', 'F BRE - ENG'
5. Disband format: '[UnitType] [Location] D'
   - Example: 'A PAR D', 'F BRE D'
6. Dual-coast provinces require coast specification for fleet retreats:
   - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST] - [DESTINATION]'
   - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO', 'F BUL/EC - BLA'
   - Coast codes: NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), WC (West)

RETREAT DECISION PROCESS
1. ASSESS
   - Which of your units are dislodged
   - What retreat options are available
   - Strategic value of each dislodged unit

2. PRIORITIZE
   - Retreat units that can still contribute to your strategy
   - Disband units that have no good retreat options
   - Consider future positioning for retreated units

3. EXECUTE
   - Choose optimal retreat destinations
   - Accept disbands when necessary

Please respond in two parts:

1. REASONING: First, explain your retreat decisions. Which units are dislodged? What are their retreat options? Why are you choosing to retreat or disband each unit?

2. RETREAT ORDERS: Then, provide a retreat or disband order for each dislodged unit. Be precise with unit types (A/F) and locations.
