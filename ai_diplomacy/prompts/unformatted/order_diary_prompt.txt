ORDER DIARY ENTRY - POST-ORDER REFLECTION

You have ALREADY SUBMITTED the following orders for this turn:
{orders_list_str}

Power: {power_name}
Phase: {current_phase}

GAME CONTEXT (state BEFORE orders were executed):
{board_state_str}

Your Strategic Framework:
Goals: {agent_goals}
Relationships: {agent_relationships}

IMPORTANT TASK
You have ALREADY SUBMITTED your orders (listed above). Now write a diary entry reflecting on WHY you chose these specific orders.

This is NOT about choosing new orders - it's about documenting your reasoning for the orders you ALREADY SUBMITTED.

RESPOND IN TWO PARTS:

1. REASONING: Explain your strategic thinking:
   - What threats were you responding to when you chose these orders?
   - What opportunities were you trying to seize?
   - How did your relationships and recent negotiations influence these choices?
   - What calculated risks did you decide to take?

2. ORDER SUMMARY: Provide a concise summary (1-2 sentences):
   - Briefly restate the key moves you made (e.g., "Moved armies to secure BUR and supported the attack on MUN")
   - Explain the strategic intent (e.g., "to block French expansion while gaining a foothold in Germany")
   - Note any contingencies or backup plans

REMEMBER: Focus on explaining the orders SHOWN ABOVE that you ALREADY SUBMITTED.
