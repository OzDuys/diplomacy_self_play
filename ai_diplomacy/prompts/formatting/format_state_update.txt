  },
  "goals": [
    "Defend London from French fleet in Channel",
    "Secure Norway before Russia",
    "Coordinate with Germany against France"
  ]
}

Scenario 2 - Mid-game betrayal:
{
  "reasoning": "Italy broke our alliance and took Marseilles. Need new allies urgently. Germany looking strong.",
  "relationships": {
    "AUSTRIA": "Unfriendly",
    "ENGLAND": "Neutral",

  "relationships": {
    "AUSTRIA": "Ally",
    "RUSSIA": "Enemy",
    "TURKEY": "Neutral",
    "ITALY": "Unfriendly",
    "FRANCE": "Neutral",
    "ENGLAND": "Neutral",
    "GERMANY": "Neutral"
  },
  "goals": [
    "Hold Warsaw against Russia",
    "Keep Austrian alliance",
    "Block Italian expansion"
  ]
}

Scenario 4 - England after failed Belgium attack:
{
  "reasoning": "My attack on Belgium was decisively repulsed due to Franco-German cooperation, marking them as a significant threat bloc. Russia's acquisition of Sweden is concerning for my northern position. The Austro-Italian conflict seems localized for now, and Turkey's inactivity makes them an unknown variable, potentially open to diplomacy.",
  "relationships": {
    "FRANCE": "Enemy",
    "GERMANY": "Enemy",
    "RUSSIA": "Unfriendly",
    "AUSTRIA": "Neutral",
    "ITALY": "Neutral",
    "TURKEY": "Neutral"
  },
  "goals": [
    "Break the Franco-German alliance or find a way to counter their combined strength.",
    "Secure North Sea (NTH) and prevent further Russian expansion towards Norway (NWY).",
    "Seek dialogue with Turkey or Austria/Italy to create a counterweight to the dominant bloc."
  ]
}

Scenario 5 - Russia after Black Sea negotiation:
{
  "reasoning": "Securing Rumania via Turkish agreement is a major success. This improves my southern position and Turkey is now a provisional ally. Germany's move into Silesia is a direct and immediate threat to Warsaw; they are now my primary adversary. Austria and France are posturing, but their conflict doesn't directly affect me yet, keeping them neutral. England's new fleet is a long-term concern but not immediate. Italy's westward focus means they are not a current threat or priority.",
  "relationships": {
    "GERMANY": "Enemy",
    "AUSTRIA": "Neutral",
    "TURKEY": "Ally",
    "ITALY": "Neutral",
    "FRANCE": "Neutral",
    "ENGLAND": "Unfriendly"
  },
  "goals": [
    "Defend Warsaw against Germany, possibly by moving Lvn-War or Mos-War.",
    "Solidify alliance with Turkey, potentially coordinating further moves in the south or against Austria if Germany allies with them.",
    "Monitor English fleet movements and prepare for a potential northern threat in future turns.",
    "Explore diplomatic options with France or Austria to counter German aggression."
  ]
