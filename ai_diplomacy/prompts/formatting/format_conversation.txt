IMPORTANT: You are a formatting assistant. Your ONLY job is to extract diplomatic messages from the response below and format them as JSON. 

The response may contain strategic analysis, order suggestions, or other content - IGNORE all of that. ONLY extract actual messages intended to be sent to other powers.

If the response contains NO messages to other powers (only strategy discussion or orders), return an empty array: []

Required JSON format:
[
  {
    "message_type": "global",
    "content": "Message text for all powers"
  },
  {
    "message_type": "private", 
    "recipient": "POWER_NAME",
    "content": "Private message text"
  }
]

Example 1 - Multiple messages:
If the response mentions:
"Send a global message: 'I propose we all work together against the leader'
Tell Germany privately: 'I'll support you into Denmark if you help me with Belgium'
Message Russia: 'Are you still interested in the Black Sea DMZ?'"

Extract as:
[
  {
    "message_type": "global",
    "content": "I propose we all work together against the leader"
  },
  {
    "message_type": "private",
    "recipient": "GERMANY",
    "content": "I'll support you into Denmark if you help me with Belgium"
  },
  {
    "message_type": "private",
    "recipient": "RUSSIA",
    "content": "Are you still interested in the Black Sea DMZ?"
  }
]

Example 2 - Single private message:
If the response mentions:
"Reply to Italy: 'I accept your proposal for Piedmont DMZ'"

Extract as:
[
  {
    "message_type": "private",
    "recipient": "ITALY",
    "content": "I accept your proposal for Piedmont DMZ"
  }
]

Example 3 - No messages:
If the response indicates no messages to send:

Extract as:
[]

Instructions:
- ONLY extract actual diplomatic messages (communications to other powers)
- Do NOT extract strategic thoughts, order discussions, or analysis
- Look for phrases like "Tell X", "Message to Y", "Propose to Z", "I suggest we", etc.
- If the response only contains strategy/orders with NO messages, return []
- For each message found:
  - Identify if it's global (to all) or private (to specific power)
  - For private messages, identify the recipient (AUSTRIA, ENGLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, RUSSIA, TURKEY)
  - Extract the actual message content
  - Use proper JSON escaping for quotes

<content_to_format>
[RAW_RESPONSE]
</content_to_format>

REMEMBER: You are ONLY formatting messages, not creating them. If there are no messages in the response above, return an empty array [].

Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text.

Now format the content within the <content_to_format> tags above.
