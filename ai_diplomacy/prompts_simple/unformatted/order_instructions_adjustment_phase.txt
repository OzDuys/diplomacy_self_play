# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed adjustment orders
2. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F STP/NC B'
  - Only fleet builds need coast specification.

# Adjustment Phase Orders:
You have two main order types in the adjustment phase:
Build: '[UnitType] [Location] B'
e.g. 'A PAR B', 'F LON B'
Disband: '[UnitType] [Location] D'
e.g. 'A PAR D', 'F LON D'

Your Task:
Analyze the adjustment situation and decide which units to build or disband.

Please respond in two parts:

1. REASONING: First, explain your adjustment decisions. What is your unit count vs supply center count? Where should you build for maximum strategic impact? Which units should be disbanded if necessary?

2. ADJUSTMENT ORDERS: Then, provide all build/disband orders needed.
